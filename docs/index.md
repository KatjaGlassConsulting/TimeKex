# Welcome to the TimeKex

TimeKex - Timetracking, Kimai meets Excel

This WebApplication is designed to allow the tracking of working hours in Excel which can then be uploaded to the Kimai Timetracking application.

<a href="https://www.kimai.org/" target="_blank">Kimai</a> is an open-source free time-tracking application which comes with a lot of functionality and capabilities. There might be situations where the times should be tracked in Excel and finally be uploaded to Kimai. TimeKex is designed to support this process.

## Status

This repository is under development. The first release is planned for Q1-2022. In this repository the source code and documentation for TimeKex will be made available.

## Prerequisites:

To be able to run TimeKex, a running instance of Kimai is required together with a user and an API key of this user. The API password can be set in Kimai via "profile", "API" and then "API Password".

There is a stable demonstration version available for Kimai which can be used for demonstration purposes (<a href="https://demo-stable.kimai.org/de/login" target="_blank">linked here</a>). To checkout demo users and specifically the API password of a demo user, check the <a href="https://www.kimai.org/demo/" target="_blank">demo information page</a>.
